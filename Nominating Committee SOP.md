# Nominating Committee SOP

This document details the role of the Nominating Committee and the specifics on how and when the various tasks should be carried out. It is provided to promote complete transparency in the election process, by allowing the election to be planned and run without the input of a serving Executive Committee member. 

The Nominating Committee is:
- composed of 5 society members.
- responsible for the execution of the tasks required to hold the election.

The mandate of the Nominating Committee is to generate the list of candidates for the ISB Executive Committee election. This may involve nominating suitable candidates and inviting them to run for election if the number of self-nominated candidates is less that the number of available posts, or reducing the number of candidates requesting to run where there is an over-subscription. The goal is to achieve composition diversity of the Executive Committee considering, but not limited, to the following factors: geographical location, career stage, gender, institutional affiliations, and expertise. Information about current EC current composition can be found here https://www.biocuration.org/about/executive-commitee/

However, equally important is the candidate's enthusiasm to serve on the executive committee and a willingness to commit an amount of time to ISB business. Minimally this involves attending monthly teleconference meetings (1 hour in length) and following up on any action points from meetings, as well as promoting the ISB's activity to members and non-members. Examples of activities performed by EC members include reviewing micro-grant submissions, preparing call for participation for hosting Biocuration meetings, preparing materials for ISB election, monitoring ISB mail and website. There are specific positions such as chair, secretary and treasurer that will require a larger time commitment, as they will be in charge of leading the steps of the executive committee and by extension the membership.

Ideally, the maximum number of candidates that may be presented for election is less than twice the number of posts up for election. i.e. 2x â€“ 1 (where x is the number of positions open in the executive committee). 

Each candidate must submit a letter of intent (maximum two pages) including the following sections:  
- **Biosketch**: include name, position, affiliation, and career experience.
- **Motivation**: describe motivations to run for a position on the ISB Executive Committee, including any specific initiatives that she/he would like to lead as a member of the EC.
- **Summary of past service** if applicable: If the candidate is a current or past EC member, a summary of past accomplishments as a member of the Executive Committee
- **Declaration of conflicts and other significant commitments**: Include, for example, leaderships of centers or consortia, editorial boards, scientific advisory boards, boards of directors, etc.
